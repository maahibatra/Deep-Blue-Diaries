            The health of our oceans is critical for the planet.<br>
            Marine ecosystems provide countless resources, from food to oxygen, and play a vital role in regulating climate.<br>
            However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change are threatening marine life.<br>
            It is essential to take action to preserve our oceans for future generations.<br>

            <div class="header-4">Why Marine Conservation Matters:</div>
            <div class="para">
            The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface and are home to more than 80% of all life forms.<br>
            They regulate weather patterns, provide livelihoods for millions of people, and are an essential source of food and oxygen.<br>
            Yet, marine life is under significant threat due to:<br>
            
                &rarr; Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices.<br>
                &rarr; Coral reef destruction due to climate change and pollution.<br>
                &rarr; Pollution from plastics and other harmful waste.<br>
                &rarr; Loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="header-4">Key Areas of Focus:</div>
            <div class="para">
                &rarr; Coral Reefs Protection:<br>
                Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth.<br>
                They protect coastlines from storms, provide habitat for marine life, and support local economies.<br>
                In India, the coral reefs around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep are under threat due to rising sea temperatures and pollution.<br>
            
                &rarr; Sustainable Fishing Practices:<br>
                Overfishing is a growing concern, especially in developing countries like India, where fisheries are critical to local economies.<br>
                Moving towards sustainable fishing practices can help replenish fish stocks and protect marine ecosystems.<br>
                Efforts are being made worldwide, but more needs to be done to create sustainable fisheries.<br>
            
                &rarr; Plastic Pollution:<br>
                Plastics make up a large percentage of marine litter.<br>
                These plastics harm wildlife and ecosystems, and their impact is devastating for marine animals that ingest or become entangled in plastic waste.<br>
                India, with its large population and rapid urbanization, faces a significant challenge with plastic waste management.<br>

# Deep-Blue-Diaries

## Description

Journalling can be so boring nowadays. I mean, where's the fun? All the webapps for journalling are mirrors of mirrors of uncreativity. I decided to put an end to that, making a creative website for journalling with an ocean-themed look.
However, that's not the only aspect of this project.
Oceans matter so much to the world; so do the living creatures in the ocean. Inspired by my cute stuffed toy, Wayle, who sits on my table, I wanted to give resources and knowledge to people through this website.
Clean the oceans, donate to charitable causes, and do whatever you can to save these precious pools of life.
